# Clue Model
This repository contains an Android app for maintaining a perfect scorecard in the murder mystery board game Clue.  Additionally the app is capable of suggesting good (though likely non-optimal) questions to ask.

## Work In Progress
Currently under developement.  Question strategies and the front end are currently unfinished.
